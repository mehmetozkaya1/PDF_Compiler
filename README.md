# PDF Editor
A small tool created to edit pdf using Python language tkinter and pypdf2 library.
## Definition
A tool that I developed with my friend [Mehmet]([http://www.example.com](https://github.com/mehmetozkaya1)) to facilitate the repetitive task of editing PDFs in daily life.

It is a customized format for our own use and only works correctly with certain pdf formats.

Its main purpose is to delete copy pages and add blank pages in order to bring the PDFs used by teachers in classes into a note-taking form.

There are a few aspects that need to be developed and completed. We will continue to work on it over time.
